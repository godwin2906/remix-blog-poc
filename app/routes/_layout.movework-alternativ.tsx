      <h2>What is MoveWorks?</h2>
      <p>
        MoveWorks is an AI-driven platform designed to revolutionize IT Service
        Management (ITSM). By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and
        machine learning, MoveWorks enables organizations to automate support
        workflows and offer real-time assistance through chatbots and virtual
        agents. The platform helps IT teams streamline service requests,
        incident management, and knowledge sharing, significantly improving
        operational efficiency and user experience.
      </p>

      <h2>How MoveWorks Works?</h2>
      <p>
        MoveWorks works by integrating with an organizationâ€™s existing ITSM
        tools, like ServiceNow or Jira, to automate and accelerate IT support
        processes. The platform uses AI to handle routine tasks such as ticket
        creation, incident resolution, and service requests. It provides
        intelligent recommendations, guides users through troubleshooting steps,
        and can even suggest solutions based on historical data.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of its key features is the virtual agent, which can interact with
        employees in natural language, either via chat or voice. This allows
        users to get immediate support without waiting for a human agent, making
        IT support faster and more efficient.
